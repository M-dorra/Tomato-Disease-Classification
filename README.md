# üçÖ Tomato Disease Classification with TensorFlow and FastAPI

This project is a web application for detecting **tomato leaf diseases** from images. It uses a trained **deep learning model (TensorFlow)** served with **FastAPI** and tested through a lightweight **HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend**.

## üß† Features

- Deep learning model to classify tomato leaf images.
- Built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras
  - Dataset caching and prefetching for performance optimization
  - Image resizing and normalization to standardize input
  - Data augmentation to improve generalization
- FastAPI backend for serving predictions
- Frontend for image upload and displaying results
- CORS-enabled for smooth frontend-backend communication
- RESTful API ready for deployment and testing (Postman supported)
